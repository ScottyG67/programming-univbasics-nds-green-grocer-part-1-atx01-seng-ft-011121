  # Implement me first!

  # Consult README for inputs and outputs
  #collection is AoH, each hash has 3 attributes, :item, :price, :clearance
  #name is String and corrliates to :item in collection
  #need to return full hash with :item==name and nill if no match

def consolidate_cart(cart)
  # Consult README for inputs and outputs
  #
  # REMEMBER: This returns a new Array that represents the cart. Don't merely
  # change `cart` (i.e. mutate) it. It's easier to return a new thing.
