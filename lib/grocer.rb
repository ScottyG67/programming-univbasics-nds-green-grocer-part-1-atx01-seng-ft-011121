  # REMEMBER: This returns a new Array that represents the cart. Don't merely
  # change `cart` (i.e. mutate) it. It's easier to return a new thing.

  #need to return AoH, each hash has 4 attributes, :item,:price, :clearance (from cart) and :count which is the number of times this hash was in cart
